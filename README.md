## **Introduction**

This project is a real-time, collaborative drawing application that allows users to draw simultaneously on a shared canvas. The app supports multiple rooms, where users can create and join different collaborative spaces. Each roomâ€™s canvas state is saved, ensuring that users can reconnect and continue where they left off. The application also features undo/redo functionality, brush customization, and a user-friendly interface.

## **Features**

- **Real-Time Drawing Synchronization**: Multiple users can draw on the same canvas simultaneously, with updates happening in real-time.
- **Multi-Room Functionality**: Users can create or join separate rooms, each with its own collaborative drawing space.
- **Undo and Redo**: Users can undo and redo their actions across all participants in the same room.
- **Persistent Canvas States**: The canvas state is saved in the database, allowing users to resume their work after disconnecting.
- **Brush Customization**: Adjustable brush size and color picker for customized drawing experiences.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with Material-UI, the app is responsive and works on various screen sizes.
